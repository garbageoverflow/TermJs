# Making node.js interact with the web page

Problem:
The title says it, node.js is simply not made to interact with web pages. 

Temporary solution:
Create an localhost and then interact with the web page, this might not work if someone wants to use TermJS in a web page. 
But for electron applications, it's just fine.
